                <h1>Improving efficiency by 91%</h1>
                <h3>The problem</h3>
                <p>Rolls Royce were looking to migrate a large amount of files onto servers in another country. Before migrating these files they had to make sure they didn't contain sensitive data. A team in Rolls Royce were manually reading through files looking for sensitive terms, barely making a dent in the millions of files that needed to be reviewed.</p>
                <p>Whilst working as a consultant on behalf of Aiimi, I was tasked with designing a product that would allow this team to review files much more efficiently.</p>
                <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The amount of files being reviewed in 6 months were being reviewed in two weeks once our tool went live. That's a massive 91% improvement.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <h4>Understanding the business process</h4>
                <p>I sat with stakeholders to gain a better understanding of what the review process was from the businesses perspective. To ensure our product would help reviews pass any compliance audits, I asked about what a review actually needed to consist of and what information needed to be captured by the reviewer and why.</p>
                <h4>Interviews and shadowing</h4>
                <p>I then interviewed and shadowed the team of file reviewers to gain a deep understanding of their existing process and identify any pain-points and opportunities. A key insight was that users had a set list of terms that they would try to find in huge files, if they found these terms they would list it in a spreadsheet which would eventually lead to it being flagged as unfit for migration abroad.</p>

                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <h4>User story mapping</h4>
                <p>Using the insights gained from the research stage we created a user story map. This map was used to gain a shared understanding of user needs and what our MVP would be working towards.</p>
                <h4>Understanding technical limitations</h4>
                <p>With the identified user needs in mind, the development team and I discussed what was and wasn't possible. This discussion ultimately led to us coming up with the ideas that would make this product such a success:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We'd have the product crawl files looking for key terms, any terms found would be presented in a file report which could be used by reviewers to quickly make a decision on the file's risk. This would remove the need for reviewers to read through massive files.</li>
                    <li>The reviewers risk rating could be captured in our product and trigger it to tag the file appropriately. This would remove the need for reviewers to manually create a log in a spreadsheet and another employee finding the file and tagging it.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Wireframing and Prototyping</h4>
                <p>I used Sketch and Invision to produce a basic prototype that could be used to gather initial feedback from stakeholders and senior members of the review team.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="caption">Wireframe of reveiwers page</p>
                <h4>Usability testing</h4>
                <p>After agreeing with stakeholders which hypothesis I'd be testing, I conducted usability testing to gain insights on how well the designs performed. The designs performed very well and we were able to identify some key problems with labelling and copy.</p>
                <h4>Final designs</h4>
                <p>Using Sketch, a UI designer and I then produced final UI designs that adhered to the Rolls Royce brand guidelines.</p>

                <h3>Going live</h3>
                <h4>Enhancements</h4>
                <p>I created a plan on how we could gain further insights post release. This plan consisted of analytics analysis, user shadowing and A/B testing. Unfortunately I left the business before this plan could come into fruition.</p>
                <h4>Outcomes</h4>
                <p>Despite not being able to go through the 'learn and improve' process, the product performed extremely well when released. The amount of files being reviewed in 6 months were being reviewed in two weeks once our tool went live. That's a massive 91% improvement.</p>
